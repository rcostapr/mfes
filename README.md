# MFES - Métodos Formais em Engenharia de Software
The Vienna Development Method (VDM) was originally developed at the IBM laboratories in Vienna in the 1970’s and as such it is one of the longest established formal method.  This document is a common language manual for the three dialects for VDM-SL, VDM++ and VDM-RT in the VDM-10 commonly agreed language revision.  These dialects are supported by both VDMTools (in the appropriate version) as well as in the Overture open source tool built on top of the Eclipse platform.  Whenever a construct is common to the three different dialects the
term “VDM languages” will be used.  Whenever a construct is specific to a subset of the VDM languages the specific dialect term mentioned above will be mentioned explictly

## Practical work on VDM++ 
### Goals  
The goal of this practical work is to develop, test and document an executable formal model of a high integrity software 
system in VDM++ using the Overture tool or the VDMTools. At the end of the work, students should have acquired the 
ability of formally modeling software systems in VDM++, and of demonstrating the consistency of the model. The work 
is to be performed by groups of two to three students attending the same class (turma). The groups will be defined and 
the themes assigned (different themes for different groups in the same class).
